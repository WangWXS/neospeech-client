NeoSpeech Java Client
=====================

This is just a trivial example of a Spring Boot application and a MVC configuration to call an external REST service.
The application connects to NeoSpeech https://tts.neospeech.com/rest_1_1.php REST endpoint, submits a XML payload containing the request for a text-to-speech conversion.

*N.B.*: NeoSpeech provides a free subscription with limited functionalites. You have to subscribe to NeoSpeech and provide your personal credential modifying the application.properties.
